### To-Do list

 **General to-dos**
 
 - ~~Create "Slot" class and make "stem used" marking sensible~~
 - Re-write sentence parsing
    - Move stress parsing from individual word types to general word level
    - Reimplement Mood/Case-Scope distinction in modular adjuncts
 - Implement suppletive adjunct forms into PRAs (potentially eliminate them as a distinct class?)
 - ~~Rewrite parseAffixual and parseAffixualScoping~~
 - Add in Vk glottalization
 - Help testing with "glossesTo" infix function
 - ~~Separate determining the type of a word into a separate function (for testability)~~
 - Create an actual error type instead of mucking about with null characters
