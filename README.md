# TNILGloss

A Discord parser bot for the new Ithkuil language

Currently outdated and works for morphophonology v0.14.3.

## How to run

1. If you’re running the Discord bot (rather than the CLI), place the token
   file in `resources/token.txt`. If you’re not using Docker, also optionally
   provide `resources/roots.tsv` and `resources/affixes.tsv`.
2. Compile with Docker or Maven.

[TODO: How to get the CLI working?]
